# Interactive-Orbitals-Simulation
 This project was fuelled by two students’ determination to create a computer simulation of orbitals that was interactive, easy-to-use and could be employed as a teaching tool by their Chemistry professor.                 We can never know for sure where an electron will find itself at a given moment. This is why scientists have come up with atomic orbitals, three-dimensional maps of the probability distribution of the location of electrons in atoms. In other words, they are shapes that show where an electron is most likely to be found in the space around the nucleus. Schrodinger’s equations can be used to create these shapes or their wave functions but since they were too complicated for our mathematical understanding we approximated them using quadric surfaces. After doing some research (the mathispower4u series on the subject was especially useful) we decided to combine several different quadric surfaces to create the orbitals. Using grapher, a free graphing utility on Mac, we came up with the equations.
